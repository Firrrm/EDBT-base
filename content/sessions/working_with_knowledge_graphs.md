Knowledge graphs are an important asset for many AI applications, such as personal assistants and semantic search, and a valuable resource for related fields of research. They are also, of course, a conceptual umbrella that spans rather different methods and approaches in the intersection of databases, knowledge representation, information extraction, knowledge management, and web technologies. This course focusses on the effective handling and usage of knowledge graphs. For a concrete and motivating example, we will dive into Wikidata, the knowledge base of Wikipedia, as used, e.g., by Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. We will discuss data access and query answering, and explain how to use this resource in own projects. Moving beyond the well-established technologies, we then take a look at advanced rule-based reasoning approaches for inferring implicit information and validating (possibly recursive) schema constraints. The course aims at combining principled insights from foundational research with pragmatic perspectives that can be put to use in hands-on exercises.
