Advanced data analytics applications require scalable and highly effective approaches for data integration to combine the information from multiple, heterogeneous data sources. Entity resolution (ER) is a key step in this process that aims at identifying all representations of the same real-world entities, such as customers or products. The ER problem has already received much attention in research and practice as can be seen from the availability of many products and prototypical tools. Still there are significant problems needing further research such as support for holistic entity resolution to integrate data from many sources, e.g., to build knowledge graphs. Furthermore, there is a need for incremental ER approaches that can deal with dynamically changing data sources and support the seamless addition of new data sources. In the tutorial, we first provide an overview of the main steps in an entity resolution solution pipeline. We discuss methods to improve scalability, in particular blocking and parallel processing, e.g., based on Hadoop platforms, and related problems such as load balancing. A particular focus will be given to methods for entity clustering to holistically match entities from many sources. We further discuss ideas for incremental entity clustering and methods for repairing entity clusters.
