Networks (or graphs) are used to represent and analyze large datasets of objects and their relations. Typical examples of graph applications come from social networks, traffic networks, electric power grids, road systems, the Internet, chemical and biological systems, and more. Naturally, real-world networks have a temporal component: for instance, interactions between objects have a timestamp and a duration. In this tutorial we will present models and algorithms for mining temporal networks, i.e., network data with temporal information. We will overview different models used to represent network networks. We will highlight the main differences between static and temporal networks, and we will discuss the challenges arising from introducing the temporal dimension in the network representation. Finally, we will present recent papers addressing the most well-studied problems in the setting of temporal networks, including centrality measures, community detection and graph partitioning, event and anomaly detection, and network summarization.
