Anna Bernasconi works as a researcher in Politecnico di Milano, within the “Data-driven Genomic Computing” ERC Awarded project (2016-2021), under the supervision of Professor Stefano Ceri. In 2021 she obtained her PhD cum laude in Information Technology with a thesis titled: “Model, Integrate, Search... Repeat: a Sound Approach to Building Integrated Repositories of Genomic Data”, proposing several conceptual models for biologyrelated research. Her research is on bioinformatics data and metadata integration methodologies to support complex biological query answering. Main expertise areas include conceptual data design, data integration, data cleaning, and semantic web. She co-organized and chaired the CMLS 2020 workshop (for which she is editing a BMC Bioinformatics Journal Supplement) and will be co-organizer of CMLS 2021 at ER 2021. She participated as paper author to ER 2017, ER 2019, ER 2020, ER2021, and to the workshop EmpER 2019. She has given seminars on conceptual models and data integration for genomics at Politecnico di Milano, IBM Zurich, ETH Zurich, and EPFL Lausanne
